crsid,CRS ID provided by donor,"The CRS Id number ensures the unicity of each transaction in the database, and possibly the link between original commitments and subsequent disbursements over several years. The format needs to be common to all donors and is fixed to ten digits: YYYYxxxxxx. It is a sequential number starting with the four digits of the original commitment year of the activity and is unique throughout the activity life (original commitment, subsequent increases and disbursements). Where more than one agency reports from the same country, each agency should preferably use its own block of numbers.","Ogni donatore (Italia nel nostro caso) ha una sua numerazione progressiva ma, in caso di più agenzie, è possibile assegnare ad ognuna di esse un blocco di numeri.",Converged Statistical Reporting Directives (CRSD)   http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCD-DAC(2013)15-FINAL-ENG.pdf  paragraph 283

shortdescription,Aim or destination sector of a bilateral fund / CRS short description,"Precise descriptions are particularly valuable to users who undertake detailed sectoral studies or whose task is to co-ordinate aid activities in a country. Provide as much detail as possible within the limit of 150 characters: (i) Avoid unnecessary wording. (E.g. prefer “Small farmers’ credit scheme” to “The programme aims at improving living standards for small scale farmers through loans to raise agricultural production”. Prefer “Voters’ education programme” to “The programme assists in the education of citizens to participate fully in elections.) (ii) Avoid simply repeating the generic name of the sector or purpose of aid which is given in field 15. (iii) Distinguish the provision of goods from the provision of equipment to produce goods. [E.g., “fertiliser delivery”, “fertiliser production equipment”, “fertiliser plant rehabilitation (equipment)”.",Descrizione breve e Titolo del progetto si riportano nella stessa cella (max 150 caratteri),Converged Statistical Reporting Directives (CRSD)   http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCD-DAC(2013)15-FINAL-ENG.pdf  paragraph 297
longdescription,Long description in English,"Many agencies’ databases contain project summaries or descriptions of the main objectives of the activity. These can be included in the CRS++ database in a text field of unrestricted length. The information permits the Secretariat to check the accuracy and consistency of purpose coding. In addition, descriptive information is valuable in detailed sectoral studies, and allows users to make research on topics (sectors or themes) not separately identified in existing classifications (e.g. disability), using keyword searches","Descrizione del progetto più articolata, ove disponibile.",Converged Statistical Reporting Directives (CRSD)   http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCD-DAC(2013)15-FINAL-ENG.pdf  paragraph 300

(ii) If changes need to be made to transactions reported in previous years to correct past errors (either in the amount or the qualitative information), report a revision. Fill out all data fields including the ones that have not been revised. (iii) For increases or disbursements on commitments reported in previous years, the identification number of the original commitment should preferably be used. If, for example, a disbursement in 2011 is reported on a transaction initially committed in 2010 with the CRS Id “2010100001”, the disbursement will carry the CRS Id “2010100001” with a nature of submission equal to 3.",Assieme al codice CRSID permette di seguire negli anni l'andamento finanziario di un progetto.,Converged Statistical Reporting Directives (CRSD)   http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCD-DAC(2013)15-FINAL-ENG.pdf  paragraph 284-5-6
FTC,FTC (Free-standing technical co-operation),"Free-standing technical co-operation comprises activities financed by a donor country whose primary purpose is to augment the level of knowledge, skills, technical know-how or productive aptitudes of the population of developing countries, i.e. increasing their stock of human intellectual capital, or their capacity for more effective use of their existing factor endowment. This relates essentially to activities that either enhance or supply human resources. It includes financing of students and trainees who are nationals of developing countries; experts, teachers, and volunteers; equipment and materials for training; research; development-oriented social and cultural programmes, etc. Associated supplies are also classified as technical co-operation.","Iniziative di cooperazione il cui scopo prioritario consiste nell'aumentare il livello di conoscenze, competenze, knowhow tecnico e attitudini produttive della popolazione dei PVS.",Converged Statistical Reporting Directives (CRSD)   http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/documentupload/DCD-DAC(2013)15-FINAL-ENG.pdf  paragraph 126

They may be selected by answering the question “would the activity have been undertaken without this objective?”. Significant (secondary) policy objectives are those which, although important, are not one of the principal reasons for undertaking the activity. The score not targeted means that the activity has been screened against, but was found not be targeted to, the policy objective. An activity can have more than one principal or significant policy objective.
