By promoting innovative approaches to management in two pilot protected areas (Buna River Protected Landscape and Shebenik –Jabllanicë National Park), the project aims also to support the broad range of benefits that the local and wider communities could enjoy from preserved and well-functioning ecosystems.
Main beneficiaries are the Institutions responsible for the planning and management of PAs at both central and regional level (MoE offices), the local communities of the two pilot PAs in terms of their enhanced capacity for the direct participation in sustainable protected area management, local scientific institutions (Universities in Tirana, Shkodra and Elbasan), NGOs and the private sector, which will be involved in the provisions of ecosystem services.
The project respond to the need expressed by the GoA in the Environmental Cross-cutting Strategy (ECS) for the period 2007-2013, of “Protection and improvement of biodiversity, protected areas and species with the purpose of preserving the natural and cultural heritage of our environment in line with our European and international commitments”. From an initial planned duration of 3 years, the project has been extended to 5 years.

Italy supported it within the IFIs, approving a national law and signing several bilateral agreements. The debt agreement with Peru aims to cancel the debt owed by Peru to Italy for ODA loans, transforming its payment in the creation of a fund based in Peru used to finance poverty reduction projects implemented by NGOs, universities and local governments. The Fondo Italo Peruano – FIP has been created with a first agreement in 2001, then renovated with a second agreement in 2007. FIP managed more than 200 million US dollar, financing around 300 projects. The two governments, with a participation of Peruvian civil society in the Technical Committee, manage FIP jointly. FIP selects projects through public calls for proposal. The projects have to target one or more aspects of multidimensional poverty and have to respect a ‘gender approach’. 
Italy is committed in the participation to FIP with a specific technical assistance program, to sustain the managing of the Fund.

The conversion mechanism works as a transaction where the government of the crediting Country withdraws part of the foreign debt of the borrowing country, in exchange for a commitment by the debtor's government to invest the corresponding amount in initiatives, bilaterally agreed, aiming at poverty reduction and development, according to national priorities.
The Italo-Egyptian Debt Swap (IEDS) Programme started in 2001 and, up to date, comprehends three distinct phases which are characterised by different methodologies and approaches, as well as timings. The Phase 1 (agreement signed in 2001) has been completed, while the Phases 2 (agreement signed in 2007) and 3 (agreement signed in 2012) are currently being implemented.
A Swap Fund has been dedicated to the Programme and used for the implementation of projects, in accordance with the guidelines and programmatic principles shared by both Countries, and aiming to promote the socio-economic development of Egypt. In addition, a technical support unit to the IEDS' management committee has been constituted, thanks to a grant of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, to ensure the effective and efficient use of the resources and the optimal implementation of all three IEDS' phases' projects.
The strategy adopted under the Programme attracts the attention of the Egyptian government on different sectors, from the application of communication and information technology, to rural development, to the environmental sector and the management of water resources, without leaving behind crucial themes, such as protecting the rights of women and children.
The IEDS, in addition to ensuring the contribution of other donors and the commitment of substantial national resources, allows the initiation of partnerships between national and international organizations, as well as with government institutions and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). In all concerned areas, Italy offers an added value in terms of transfer of skills, know-how and technologies, including through the involvement of Italian academic institutions and centers of excellence, which provide a solid experience in various fields of intervention.

At  this  level,  the  shortage  of  budget  allocations  for  capital  costs, coupled with the lack of planning, implementation and monitoring capacity, turns into an overall inadequate services provision to the population. Through this Programme, the Government of Italy contributes with a grant to the revolving fund of the Water Resources Development Fund (WRDF), the office of the Ministry of Water Irrigation and Energy, dedicated to “Urban Wash”. This will strengthen  the  financing  of  the  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector.  The grant will be channeled by the WRDF, through loans, to 5 eligible TWUs which will operate on cost recovery principles and, meanwhile, foster the gradual building up of local resources so as to guarantee the sustainable development of the sector.
The Programme aligning objectives and methodologies followed by other donors as World Bank (WB), African Development Bank (AfDB), UNICEF, Finland and DFID.

Italy supported it within the IFIs, approving a national law and signing several bilateral agreements. The debt agreement with Peru aims to cancel the debt owed by Peru to Italy for ODA loans, transforming its payment in the creation of a fund based in Peru used to finance poverty reduction projects implemented by NGOs, universities and local governments. The Fondo Italo Peruano – FIP has been created with a first agreement in 2001, then renovated with a second agreement in 2007. FIP managed more than 200 million US dollar, financing around 300 projects. The two governments, with a participation of Peruvian civil society in the Technical Committee, manage FIP jointly. FIP selects projects through public calls for proposal. The projects have to target one or more aspects of multidimensional poverty and have to respect a ‘gender approach’. 
Italy is committed in the participation to FIP with a specific technical assistance program, to sustain the managing of the Fund.

The Museum of Midan Tahrir, focus of the project, gathers the most important collection of Egyptian art in the world and is at the heart of the Egyptian museum system. Precisely for this reason, the constant intervention of the Italian Cooperation, aiming at strengthening its capacity at different levels, had the advantage of triggering a virtuous circle that allows to reach an ambitious, as fundamental, objective: the redevelopment of the whole Egyptian museum system.
The project allowed the implementation of a training program for the conservation and restoration of the Cairo Egyptian Museum's collection. The small wooden head of Tutankhamun child, the famous portraits of Fayoum and the head of Queen Hashepsut, are just a few, among the most important works, which have been the subject of study and restoration interventions within those courses.
The Master Plan, implemented under the program, intends to ameliorate the museum's organization and management, including its exhibitions and presentation to the public. The Plan is taking into consideration both the museological and the musegraphical aspects (relationship between the museum and the surrounding urban space, architectural restoration and exhibition design) and the architectural aspects too (new spaces needed for additional services: bookshop, refreshment areas, classrooms, offices, laboratories, etc.).",RIQUALIFICAZIONE SISTEMA MUSEALE - MASTER PLAN MIBAC,16061,Culture and recreation,160,Other Social Infrastructure & Services,11000,Donor Government,MINISTERO PER I BENI E LE ATTIVITA' CULTURALI,Africa (North of Sahara),19/12/2007,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,19120

The initiative was part of the context of integrated management of water resources and within the general framework of the rehabilitation process following the regional conflict in Casamance. The project was implemented through four lines of action: the construction of water infrastructure; the construction of sanitation infrastructure; the implementation of activities aimed at the knowledge of the population on the benefits arising from the consumption of drinking water, the basic principles of hygiene and waterborne diseases; the realization of activities dedicated to the proper management of water resources and in compliance with the gender dynamics.

The effects derived from the implementation of the project activities have involved three main aspects: the socio-cultural, economico-financial and institutional. Per regarding the socio cultural, whose backbone is represented by the role of women, the presence of a tap to 'interior of each grant has helped to redefine the times and priorities in every day life, increasing the degree of awareness on the benefits arising from the use of drinking water and in general has allowed a significant improvement in the quality of village life. On the institutional side, the strong involvement of local communities in the management of water services is translated into a number of actions in support dele project activities, what has increased their 'credibility and professionalism in the field, coming closer the interests of rural services to the authorities central often distant and not very present in the contexts of the village. Finally, the improvement in terms of economic and financial water service has been guaranteed by the formations that have affected the members of the executive ASUFOR, user associations aqueduct. In this sense, the important goal achieved led strengthening the link between services and users, the latter co-responsible for the proper functioning of the aqueduct through the regular payment of bills and their involvement in the regular meetings of ASUFOR.

This strategy is implemented through interventions focused mainly on the transfer of technology and knowledge. In agreement with the local authorities, a program of technical assistance is carried out to the local public health institutions through the selection and deployment of experts (""formative accompaniment"") together with the direct strengthening of the health services (supply of materials, reagents, equipment ).

The expected results are:
1.	Governorate Offices and the Provincial Institutions are reinforced in their management capacities, and in coordinating development strategies and provincial level governance.
2. Coordination between Governorate Offices/Provincial Departments is reinforced towards the central institutions.
3. Coordination between Governorate Offices and the sub-Provincial institutions (districts, municipalities, community institutions) is reinforced. 
Since 2011, within the project, Italian and Afghan staff have been provided to support at a technical level the Governorate Offices and the Herat Provincial Institutions. 
Nowadays the project continues its activies through local contracts that technically supports the Provincial Institutions. Some activities are suspended at the moment, since some governance programs of UNDP are in a restructuring phase (ASGP, NIBP).

In line with national strategies, the initiative promotes socio-economic empowerment of women and the improvement of anti-violence services. Starting from the results obtained in the first phase, the programme concentrates on the creation of reference points for employment and for services fighting against gender violence and promoting the reintegration into society of women who were victims of violence.

The MoWA and the 11 West Bank Governorates are the institutional counterparts to whom the activities of institution building, gender budget, gender audit and gender accountability are targeted. The more than 230 women’s organisations and local institutions which form part of the TAWASOL centres are beneficiaries of services for job orientation and for violence prevention.

The project envisages a range of interventions targeting the grass root and local level that are inspired by the methodology of ‘Children Friendly Cities’, a concept developed in the framework of the Convention for Protection of Child. These actions will draw on the involvement of three Lebanese municipalities and build on their willingness to identify and implement specific Local Plans of Action for the upholding of the well being and the promotion of fundamental rights of minors living in those neighbourhoods. This pilot intervention will target Northern Lebanon with a view to balancing the engagement of the Italian cooperation in favour of Lebanese population that has so far predominantly focused on the Southern districts of the country.

Great importance is placed on the importance of access to water as a priority in the fight against inequality.The project focuses on the planning and management of water resources, ensuring that such efforts are based on established guidelines, rules of conduct and best practices of participatory processes, without gender discrimination.
GCIt apply this project model in the Gouriki Samba Diom (Matam Region) and Bokhol (Saint Louis Region) villages, two rural areas that have long based their economy on an extensive and poorly mechanized agricultural system. In these areas, Green Cross will recover 60 hectares of wasteland for cultivation,complementing local food security and bringing economic benefits to agricultural workers. Solar panels covering 500 square meters will be installed, capable of producing 250,000 kw of electricity per year, and allowing farmers to reduce reliance on diesel-powered water pumps, in turn bringing about a 35% reduction in total production costs, and potential zero CO2 emissions. New irrigation systems “Drop by drop” will be employed and divided into main pipelines and peripheral devices, using approximately720 kilometers of pipes;480 kilometers of pipe in the Gouriki Samba Diom village and 240 in the Bokhol village. The objective is to minimize water and energy consumption in these areas, as well as producing better crops and more over this system will greatly reduce water consumption of the Senegal River, saving more than 800 million liters of water each year. To promote the role of women in Senegalese society, Green Cross Italy will give leadership roles to women to oversee aspects of the project’s implementation, as well as insisting that over half of the more than 900 direct beneficiaries of the Freddas project be women.",FREDDAS RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SENEGAL RIVER VALLEY - INSURANCE AND SOCIAL CHARGES,23067,Solar energy,230,Energy,11000,Donor Government,,Africa (South of Sahara),06/08/2012,19/03/2014,,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,31/12/2014,,,24878

A social enterprise will therefore be created, which will incubate market-based sustainable and replicable solutions for the sanitation supply chain.
