Bangladesh, etc). They are cheaper than mechanized boreholes, easy to implement as the equipment is locally done, able to provide clean water if correctly applied. But manual drilling is feasible only where suitable hydrogeological conditions are (shallow layers not to hard and
groundwater not deeper than 25 m). Therefore a preliminary identification of suitable areas is necessary.
